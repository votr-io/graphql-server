- As a participant in an election, should I be able to see the full list of registered voters?
  - My feeling is no. If it was somehow just first names, then maybe, but we most likely only have email addresses, and we can't just put those out there.
- As the owner of a private election, should I be able to see who has voted and who hasn't? If so, should that info also be listed on the election page for anyone who has access to see it?
  - My feeling is no. It gives the owner of the election far more visibility than the voters given my feelings on the above question of not displaying email addresses.

* do candidates need ids? probably not, but I'm going to put them in anyway. don't see that hurting anything.

Private election considerations:

- think about what can happen with deregistering people that still posses the registration link? do we care?
